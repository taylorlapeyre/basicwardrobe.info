      intro: A good pair of jeans is the most versatile clothing item in your wardrobe. Jeans are casual, and can be worn consecutively more than any other pant. They are an item that you will almost certainly want to invest in and allow to grow with you. For this reason, I suggest a pair of raw denim.

      intro: Chinos (also known as “khakis”) are an important part of any wardrobe. Their generally earthy tones lend themselves very well to matching other clothes. Chinos are very easy to dress up or down (moreso than jeans), and pair very well with button downs.

      intro: While very seasonal, shorts are essential to any wardrobe that wants to remain relevant in the warmer months of the year. In terms of colors, shorts fall under the same category as chinos. However, it’s virtually impossible to dress shorts up. You’ll want to look for specific fabrics for shorts - particurally chino, poplin, and linen.

      component_name: Oxford Button Downs
      image: assets/images/ocbd.jpg
      intro: The oxford button down is a staple of male fashion, and an item that every man should wear judiciously. Oxfords are great year-round and are easily paired with chinos, jeans, and jackets. The most important aspect of a button down is the fit of the shirt. When choosing an Oxford, look for a tailored cut and a thick collar.

Nevertheless, many people overlook the jacket’s importance. Here are some suggestions for jackets that are both light and durable.

      intro: A coat can be your best friend when the weather gets particuraly cold. Wool is probably the best matierial for a proper coat. For this reason, many people prefer a pea coat as the go-to option. While a pea coat is a very well-established item with a rich history, it can sometimes be a bit dressy for casual use. Use your discretion, and choose a shorter length coat if you plan to wear it casually.

      intro: Boots are one of the most important items of footwear in a man’s wardrobe. They are timeless and should be chosen with great care. It is very important to invest in a good pair of boots that will last a long time, conform to your feet, and develop a patina. Boots should only be worn with pants, but can go with almost any outfit.

Typically mocassin-style, these shoes include loafers, boat shoes, and trail oxfords. Like boots, these are shoes that you will want to invest heavily in.

      intro: The navy blazer practically defines the word “staple.” It’s an essential. A blazer should be cut slim to the body and should be a tad bit shorter than your arm as it lays by your side. This is an item that is worth getting tailored. Modern styling favors a double vent in the back.

      intro: Dress shirts differ from regular button-ups in that they are usually made with a higher quality fabric (look for “pinpoint”). Dress shirts usually don’t have a button down collar, are measured by collar and shoulder sizes, and are longer than a casual shirt for tucking in. These shirts (similar to all formal attire) should be tailored.

There are many different kinds of dress shoes, but the most common are plain-toe, cap-toe, and wingtip. Dress shoes, like all other leather shoes in this list, are an investment that you shouldn’t be afraid to splurge on.
