### Boots

Boots are one of the most important items of footwear in a man's wardrobe. Boots are timeless and should be chosen with great care. It is very important to invest in a good pair of boots that will last a long time, conform to your feet, and develop a patina. Boots should only be worn with pants, but can go with almost any outfit.

### Sneakers

Sometimes we just want to be straight-up causual, and there's nothing better for casual clothes than slipping on a pair of worn-in sneakers. Sneakers don't have to stand up to the same level of scrutiny as other shoes do, but some people slave over finding the perfect pair of sneakers. Grey, white, and navy are the most versatile colors.

### Casual Leather Shoes

There are going to be times when you want to dress up - but not too fancy - and sneakers and boots won't cut it. This is where a casual leather shoe comes in. Typically mocassin-style, these shoes include loafers, boat shoes, and trail oxfords. Like boots, these are shoes that you will want to invest heavily in.
